Chacha Chaudhary is a middle class Indian, frail but an extremely intelligent elder. The word chacha means uncle in Hindi, while Chaudhary is a term used for landlords. A common saying about him is that "Chacha Chaudhary ka dimagh computer se bhi tez chalta hai" (Chacha Chaudhary's brain runs faster than a computer), which is a testament to his unparalleled wisdom and wits.

Chacha Chaudhary's attire includes his red turban, a wooden stick, a waistcoat with a double inside pocket, and a pocket watch. His household consists of his wife Bini Chachi, a faithful street dog called Rocket and a giant alien from Jupiter named Sabu. He has an identical twin brother Chhajju Chaudhary, who visits him very rarely but whenever he arrives creates a funny situation. Sometimes, a tiny man called 'Tingu Master' is also shown to live with them. Chacha Chaudhary enjoys eating watermelon with relish but mangoes are his weakness, and takes off for a walk with Sabu and Rocket, whenever Chachi nags him. When he takes off his turban, it is shown that he is completely bald.

Everybody in town knows that whenever Chacha Chaudhary goes out with his family, he never locks the door of his house; but nobody has been successful in robbing his house. However, in certain stories, Chachi (his wife) has been seen locking the house.

Sometimes his head or nose itches when any trouble is going to happen.
