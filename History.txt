Chacha Chaudhary was created in 1971 for the Hindi magazine Lotpot. It soon became popular among kids and the elderly alike. Pran was inspired from the ancient philosopher Chanakya and elder people of every village who help and solve problems by their elderly experience.[4]

According to a Pran's Features press release, Indian children aged 10â€“13 years ranked Chacha Chaudhary as their most recognizable comic book character.[5]

Chacha Chaudhary has also been featured as a guest in other Pran's Features series, with Billoo, Pinki.
